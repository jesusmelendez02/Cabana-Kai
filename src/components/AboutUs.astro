          Cabana Kai was created with one simple goal:
          <span class="font-bold">to make beach days feel effortless.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a couple from coastal towns, the beach has always felt like home.
          When our son Kai was born, our desire to stay close to the ocean only
          grew stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          But every beach trip came with the same stress — packing, carrying,
          setting up… and barely relaxing.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we built Cabana Kai to offer families, couples, and friends the
          chance to just arrive and enjoy —
          <span class="font-bold">no stress, no gear, no heavy lifting.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by Kai’s love for the sea, every setup is thoughtfully
          curated with comfort, style, and the kind of calm that only the shore
          can bring.
        </p>
        <p>
          We bring the shade, the chairs, the cooler, and the vibe — so all you
          have to do is show up and soak it in.
        </p>
